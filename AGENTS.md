# Project: Neovim Configuration

## Project Overview

This directory contains a personal Neovim configuration based on the [AstroNvim](https.github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim) framework (v6 branch). It uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for plugin management and is written entirely in Lua.

The configuration is modular, with a clear separation between the core AstroNvim setup, community plugins, custom plugin configurations, and personal tweaks.

## File Structure

The most important files and directories are:

- `init.lua`: The main entry point. It bootstraps `lazy.nvim` and loads the rest of the configuration.
- `lua/lazy_setup.lua`: This file configures `lazy.nvim` and imports the core AstroNvim plugins, community plugins, and custom plugin configurations.
- `lua/community.lua`: This file is used to import plugin packs from the [AstroCommunity](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocommunity) repository. This allows for easily adding support for various languages and tools.
- `lua/plugins/`: This directory contains individual files for custom plugin configurations. Each file returns a `LazySpec` table to be loaded by `lazy.nvim`.
- `lua/polish.lua`: This file is loaded last and is intended for personal customizations and settings that should override all other configurations.
- `lazy-lock.json`: This file is automatically generated by `lazy.nvim` to lock plugin versions, ensuring a reproducible setup.

## Building and Running

This is a Neovim configuration, so there is no "build" step. To "run" it, simply start Neovim:

```bash
nvim
```

Plugin management is handled by `lazy.nvim`. Plugins are installed automatically on the first startup. You can manage plugins with the following commands inside Neovim:

- `:Lazy install`: Install any missing plugins.
- `:Lazy update`: Update all plugins.
- `:Lazy sync`: Update and clean plugins.
- `:Lazy clean`: Remove any unused plugins.

## Development Conventions

- **Plugin Management**: All plugins are managed by `lazy.nvim`. To add a new plugin, create a new Lua file in the `lua/plugins/` directory that returns a `LazySpec`. For plugins available in AstroCommunity, you can add them to `lua/community.lua`.
- **Configuration**: Configuration is done in Lua. To configure an AstroNvim module (like `astrocore` or `astrolsp`) or a plugin, you modify its `opts` table within its `LazySpec`.
- **Customization**: For general settings or overrides, use the `lua/polish.lua` file. This ensures your custom settings take precedence.
- **Structure**: The configuration is designed to be modular. Keep different concerns in separate files to maintain a clean and organized setup.
